# New Relic Node.js 3rd Party Versions
This is a utility used by the New Relic Node.js agent team.  It will clone `node-newrelic`, `newrelic-node-apollo-server-plugin` and `newrelic-node-nextjs` repos and create a 3rd party library compatibility report.

## Installation

```sh
go install github.com/newrelic/newrelic-node-versions@latest
```

### Tools

This project relies on some community tools that require extra installation:

+ [Task](https://taskfile.dev): `go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest`
+ [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run): `github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest`

## Getting Started

## Usage

```sh
./nrversions
```

Will output a compatibility report like this

```

For optional CLI args, run:

```sh
‚ùØ ./nrversions -help

This tool is used to generate a document detailing the modules that
the newrelic Node.js agent instruments and the version ranges of those
modules.

The following flags are supported:

  -n, --no-externals           Disable cloning and processing of external repos. An external repo is
                               one that provides extra functionality to the "newrelic" module. This
                               allows processing a single repo with --repo-dir. The default, i.e. not
                               supplying this flag, is to process all known external repos.
                               
  -o, --output-format string   Specify the format to write the results as. The default is an ASCII
                               table. Possible values: "ascii" or "markdown".
                                (default "markdown")
  -r, --repo-dir string        Specify a local directory that contains a Node.js instrumentation repo.
                               If not provided, the main agent GitHub repository will be cloned to a
                               local temporary directory and that will be used.
                               
  -t, --test-dir string        Specify the test directory to parse the package.json files.
                               If not provided, it will default to 'test/versioned'. This applies to
                               the repo provided by the --repo-dir flag.
                                
  -v, --verbose                Enable verbose output. As the data is being loaded and parsed various
                               logs will be written to stderr that should give indicators of what
                               is happening.
