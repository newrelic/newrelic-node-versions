## Instrumented modules

After installation, the agent automatically instruments with our catalog of
supported Node.js libraries and frameworks. This gives you immediate access to
granular information specific to your web apps and servers.  For unsupported
frameworks or libraries, you'll need to instrument the agent yourself using the
[Node.js agent API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/api-guides/nodejs-agent-api/).

**Note**: The latest supported version may not reflect the most recent supported
version.
